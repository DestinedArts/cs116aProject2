## About
Project 2 - Ray Tracer

Create your own Ray Tracer (renderer) that can render simple primitive shapes and meshes using ambient and point lighting.

**Part 1 - Setting up the Camera/View Environment**: Setup the basic camera, view plane and scene using the example classes that were provided in class and perform a one pass ray trace to generate an image of a simple scene with several spheres in ambient light to make sure it is working.<br>
**Part 2 - Shading and Shadows**: Implement Lambert and Blinn-Phong Shading with Multiple Lights. Modify your renderer to support Meshes from Lab/Project 1.<br>
**Part 3 - Planar Textures**: Add simple planar texture mapping.

**Code Editor**: Visual Studio<br>
**Library**: OpenGL (openFrameworks)

### Notes<br>
random notes taken during class

Part 1: Top part of spheres grainy because resolution is low. Increase resolution more than 1200x800 to decrease grainyness.
